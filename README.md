🏡 **Address Dataset Analysis**

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset containing addresses to extract insights such as the most common locations, address length distributions, and unique city counts. Additionally, various visualizations help illustrate key patterns in the data.

📂 Repository Structure

The repository contains Python scripts for data analysis and visualization:

**Data Processing & Analysis**

    1. max_min_average_address_name_lengths.py - Calculates the maximum, minimum, and average lengths of address names.
    
    2. most_common_city_state.py - Identifies the most frequently occurring city and state in the dataset.
    
    3. unique_cities.py - Determines the number of unique cities in the dataset.

**Visualizations**

    4. histogram_address_lengths.py - Creates a histogram showing the distribution of address name lengths.
    
    5. pie_chart_address_distribution_by_state.py - Generates a pie chart visualizing the distribution of addresses by state.
    
    6. state_with_most_cities.py - Identifies the state containing the highest number of unique cities.

🛠️ Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the scripts:

    pip install pandas matplotlib
